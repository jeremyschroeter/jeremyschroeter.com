Hi, I'm Jeremy. I was born in New York City but grew up in Seattle, Washington.
In 2023, I completed my undergraduate studies and received a BS in neuroscience
from the University of Washington. During undergrad, I conducted research at the
David Baker Lab on deep generative models for protein structure prediction and
design. My work during that time fostered in me, a passion and interest in machine learning
as a scientific tool. Currently I am at the Steinmetz lab at UW, where I work on computational
models of perceptual decision making. I am interested in the neural basis of
perception, cognition, and action, and how brains manipulate internal representations of
external variables to enable effective engagement with their environment.
